YouTube Discourse Analysis of Student Cost of Living in Seattle
This repository contains a Selenium-based web crawling and text analysis project examining how student housing, cost of living, and urban survival in Seattle are represented on YouTube. Using multiple search queries related to UW dorms, University District apartments, and student life in Seattle, the project collects video metadata, generates word clouds, and analyzes spatial and social patterns in student experience.
