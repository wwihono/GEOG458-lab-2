YouTube Discourse Analysis of Student Cost of Living in Seattle
This repository contains a Selenium-based web crawling and text analysis project examining how student housing, cost of living, and urban survival in Seattle are represented on YouTube. Using multiple search queries related to UW dorms, University District apartments, and student life in Seattle, the project collects video metadata, generates word clouds, and analyzes spatial and social patterns in student experience.

# Student Survival Geography in Seattle: Cost of Living and Housing Discourse on YouTube 
## Topic and Search Parameters

This project explores how student survival and cost of living in Seattle are represented on YouTube, with a specific focus on housing, daily expenses, and spatial constraints around the University District. Seattle is a high-cost urban environment, and students are often forced to navigate trade-offs between affordability, commute distance, and quality of life.

To capture this narrative, I ran a crawler script on the following search queries to illustrate the housing pipeline for students in Seattle:
- “u district apartments”

- "Uw seattle dorm tour"

- “living in seattle as a student”

Each search term captures a different stage in the student housing pipeline: on-campus dorm life, off-campus housing near the university, and broader urban survival within Seattle

## Motivation for comparison

I chose this comparison because housing is one of the most significant factors shaping student experience and mobility in Seattle. Rather than viewing cost of living as a single metric, this project treats it as a geographic process that unfolds across space and time.

## Word Cloud Comparison
- "U District Apartments": This word cloud is strongly shaped by economically driven language, words such as apartment, rental, condos, bedroom, and dollars are prominent. This dataset reflects the shift from institutional housing a.k.a dormitories, where students must negotiate fees, leasing, and availabilities in the private rental market.

- "UW campus dorm tour": Dominated by campus-specific language such as university, campus, and freshman, This heavily reflects how dorm-related content is usually produced as a guidance for incoming students and framed through official or semi-official narratives. These videos place an emphasis on amenities and experiences rather than cost-effectivity of long-term sustainability. Notably a lot of the economic terms that I expected were largely absent, suggesting that affordability is either assumed or obscured by the University housing system. 

-"Student life in seattle": The Student Life in Seattle word cloud expands the scale further, incorporating language related to everyday survival and mobility across the city, terms like Seattle, cost, live, need, work, utilities, commute, and apartment suggest that students frame their experience as an ongoing negotiation with urban systems rather than a fixed living arrangement.
