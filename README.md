YouTube Discourse Analysis of Student Cost of Living in Seattle
This repository contains a Selenium-based web crawling and text analysis project examining how student housing, cost of living, and urban survival in Seattle are represented on YouTube. Using multiple search queries related to UW dorms, University District apartments, and student life in Seattle, the project collects video metadata, generates word clouds, and analyzes spatial and social patterns in student experience.

# Student Survival Geography in Seattle: Cost of Living and Housing Discourse on YouTube 
## Topic and Search Parameters

This project explores how student survival and cost of living in Seattle are represented on YouTube, with a specific focus on housing, daily expenses, and spatial constraints around the University District. Seattle is a high-cost urban environment, and students are often forced to navigate trade-offs between affordability, commute distance, and quality of life.

To capture this narrative, I ran a crawler script on the following search queries to illustrate the housing pipeline for students in Seattle:
- “uw seattle dorm tour”

- “u district apartments”

- “living in seattle as a student”

Each search term captures a different stage in the student housing pipeline: on-campus dorm life, off-campus housing near the university, and broader urban survival within Seattle

## Motivation for comparison

I chose this comparison because housing is one of the most significant factors shaping student experience and mobility in Seattle. Rather than viewing cost of living as a single metric, this project treats it as a geographic process that unfolds across space and time.
